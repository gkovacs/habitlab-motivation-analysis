# First study: all users are in the 10-second countdown version of the interface. We vary the frequency with which they are shown the prompt. 4 conditions: shown prompt on 100% of visits, 50%, 25%, 0%.
# 
# Are there costs to asking what difficulty the user wants? (If there arenâ€™t we can just ask every visit and declare mission accomplished)
# 
# The actual time cost is actually rather low, a mode of 1.2 seconds time to answer the question
