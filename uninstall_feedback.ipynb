What turned me off was that the nagging would take place instantly and aggressively, new installs should default to the lowest settings and learn the habits before intervening. Using negative enforcement from the very second you tread on a site does not motivate you to change, it teaches you that HabitLab is a hardline tool that simply annoys and makes you want to turn it off - the exact opposite behaviour you are after. From my experience, fully blocking websites via my DNS was a much more enjoyable way to stop visiting sites cold-turkey and I still have these in place. Definitely consider a delay (5 mins?) before a nagging feature is used and then ramp up the annoyance factor, HabitLab is simply too abrasive out of the box.\n",

Also, ideally, you should be able to categorise types of websites and set limits for the category rather than limits being set for an individual website. Otherwise if the goal is to set a 1hr limit per day of media streaming, as the features are currently configured, you could still end up watching an hour of Netflix, an hour of Stan, an hour of Youtube, etc. in a day and still be meeting your configured target according to this tool.\n",
